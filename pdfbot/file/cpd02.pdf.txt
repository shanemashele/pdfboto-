DISEASE AND DISEASE TRANSMISSION
Chapter 2
Disease and disease transmission
An enormous variety of organisms exist, including some which can survive and
even develop in the body of people or animals. If the organism can cause
infection, it is an infectious agent. In this manual infectious agents which cause
infection and illness are called pathogens. Diseases caused by pathogens, or the
toxins they produce, are communicable or infectious diseases (45). In this manual
these will be called disease and infection.
This chapter presents the transmission cycle of disease with its different elements,
and categorises the different infections related to WES.
2.1 Introduction to the transmission cycle of disease
To be able to persist or live on, pathogens must be able to leave an infected host,
survive transmission in the environment, enter a susceptible person or animal, and
develop and/or multiply in the newly infected host.
The transmission of pathogens from current to future host follows a repeating
cycle. This cycle can be simple, with a direct transmission from current to future
host, or complex, where transmission occurs through (multiple) intermediate
hosts or vectors.
This cycle is called the transmission cycle of disease, or transmission cycle. The
transmission cycle has different elements:
The pathogen: the organism causing the infection
(cid:132)
The host: the infected person or animal ‘carrying’ the pathogen
(cid:132)
The exit: the method the pathogen uses to leave the body of the host
(cid:132)
Transmission: how the pathogen is transferred from host to susceptible person
(cid:132)
or animal, which can include developmental stages in the environment, in
intermediate hosts, or in vectors
